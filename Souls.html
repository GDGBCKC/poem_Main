        <p>
            Of all the Souls that stand create
            <br>
            I have Elected One
            <br>
            When Sense from Spirit
            <br>
            files away
            <br>
            When that which is
            <br>
            and that which was
            <br>
            Apart intrinsic stand 
            <br>
            And this brief Tragedy of Flesh 
            <br>
            Is shifted like a Sand 
            <br>
            When Figures show their royal Front
            <br>
            And Mists are carved away,
            <br>
            Behold the Atom I preferred
            <br>
            To all the lists of Clay!
