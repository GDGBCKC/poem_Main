        <h1>Tomorrow</h1>
        <p>
            People kept talking about tomorrow;
            <br>
            So I asked them it is.
            <br>
            They told me that tomorrow will be
            <br>
            when night is gone and dawn comes.
            <br>
            Anxiously waiting for a new day,
            <br>
            I slept through the night and
            <br>
            woke up to learn
            <br>
            that tomorrow was no more 
            <br>
            It was another today.
            <br>
            Friends, there is no such a thing
            <br>
            <strong>
                As tomorrow
            </strong>
