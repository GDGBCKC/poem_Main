        <p>
            Alone in the night
            <br>
            On a Dark hill
            <br>
            With pines around me
            <br>
            Over my head,
            <br>
            White and topaz
            <br>
            And misty red;
            <br>
            Myriads with beating hearts of fire
            <br>
            That aeons
            <br>
            Cannot vex or tire;
            <br>
            Up the dome of heaven
            <br>
            Like a great hill,
            <br>
            <strong>
                And I know that I am honored to be witness
                <br>
                of so much majesty.
            </strong>
